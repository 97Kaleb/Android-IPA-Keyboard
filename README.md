# Overview

This application is an IME that allows a user to input characters from the IPA as well as other characters that are important for linguistics. Once installed, enable the IPA Keyboard in your On-screen kayboard settings. You can then switch to the keyboard in the same manner in which you would switch to another keyboard.

I created this keyboard because, as far as I am aware, no similar keyboard currently exists. This is a program that I believe will help many linguists streamline their work, myself included.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This application was developed in Android Studio in Kotlin and XML. Copilot and Gemini were used to locate useful libraries, as well as for providing guidance on their usage.
