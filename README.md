# Overview

This application is an IME that allows a user to input characters from the IPA as well as other characters that are important for linguistics. Once installed, enable the IPA Keyboard in your On-screen kayboard settings. You can then switch to the keyboard in the same manner in which you would switch to another keyboard.

I created this keyboard because, as far as I am aware, no similar keyboard currently exists. This is a program that I believe will help many linguists streamline their work, myself included.
